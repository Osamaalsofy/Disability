    <h2>Interacting with People with Disabilities</h2>

            <p>First, let's look at the reasons that some people are uncomfortable with people with disabilities. <br>
                 One reason is that some people feel sorry for people with disabilities,
                  and assume that they are bitter about their disabilities. 
                  This is untrue in many cases. 
                  Lots of people with disabilities feel that their lives are enriched by their experiences with disability, 
                  and even if given the chance to erase their disability would choose not to.</p>
                  <br>

             <p>
                In an interview on Larry King Live, some people said of their disabilities:
                I wouldn't change it. I wouldn't change it if I had the opportunity. There's no way.
                It's definitely been a different path through life than I thought I'd take,
                 but it's been a great one and you know, we've said it a few times we wouldn't, I wouldn't change anything. 
             </p>     
             <br>
             <p>
                One basic question many people have is: What is appropriate terminology, for example, disability, impairment, or handicap?
                 When you're working with someone, you can ask what terminology he or she prefers. When you're speaking in public or writing, 
                you'll need to do a little research to ensure that you use widely-accepted terminology and avoid potentially offensive terminology. 
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
                The most important thing to know when interacting with people with disabilities is that they are people.
                And just like all people, they are very different, including being different in how they are with disability issues.
