         <h1>Meaning</h1>
         <h2>
            According to the definition of the World Health Organization: <br>
             “Disability is a term that covers disability, restrictions on activity, and restrictions on participation. <br>
              Disability is a problem in the function or structure of the body,
              and limiting activity is the difficulty that an individual faces in carrying out a task
               or work while restricting participation It is the problem that the individual suffers from in participating in life situations,
               and therefore disability is a complex phenomenon,
               which reflects the interaction between the features of a person’s body and the features of the society in which he or she lives. <br>
               It is also defined as a condition that limits the individual's ability to perform one or more of the functions that are essential in daily life, 
            <br> such as self-care or social relationship and economic activities,
             within the limits that are considered normal. Or it is the inability of a person to obtain self-sufficiency 
            and make him in constant need of the help of others and special education that helps him overcome his disability.

        <h2>
            Empowerment is about inclusion, about being included in local issues and services that affect you. <br>
             It is about getting your voice heard where it most matters and has maximum impact. <br>
               It is about not being forgotten and brushed under the carpet.  <br>
               It is about making decision-makers understand your needs in the local community. <br>
                It is about celebrating diversity and not being ignored because of your differences. <br>
