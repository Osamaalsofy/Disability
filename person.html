            <p>Stephen Hawking was both one of the world's most famous scientists and most famous disabled people.</p>
                  <br>

             <p>
                His life was a combination of bright intellect and a failing body.
                Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease when he was 22.
                The nerves that controlled his muscles were failing and he became trapped in his body, but his mind was still free.
                 
             </p>     
             <br>
             <p>
                He reached the height of his field while being a wheelchair user and communicating through a synthetic voice.
                A testament that disability is not “inability” and that people with disabilities can achieve anything they set their minds to.
                we can say that he was the world’s most famous and influential scientist.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
                Hawking changed the way people thought about the universe, after Having made many important scientific discoveries,
                Hawking also published books that made this information easily accessible to a wider public.
                However, Stephen Hawking not only changed the way that people thought about science, he also changed the way people perceived disability.  
                many of his greatest intellectual achievements were made whilst his body was failing!!!

             </p>
             <br>
             <p>The story of Stephen Hawking is an inspiration for those who think that disability is a hurdle for a lifetime.</p>
